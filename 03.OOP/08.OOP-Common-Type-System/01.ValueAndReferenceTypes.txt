Problem 1: Value and Reference Types

- Value types: 
	1.Structs, Enumerations, Integer, Float, Double, Decimal, Bool
	2.Create a new copy ot the value.
	3.The value gets passed as argument.
	4.Stack
	5.Value types are Mutable.
- Reference types: 
	1.Class, Interface, Delegate, Dynamic, Object, String
	2.Create pointer(reference) to already assigned value.
	3.A pointer to the value gets passed as argument.
	4.Heap
	5.Value types are Immutable.
	
	The REF keyword causes an argument to be passed by reference, not by value.
	The OUT is like the ref keyword, except that ref requires that the variable be initialized before it is passed.
