    Abstraction allows us to define properties and behavior in a general way and leave the implementation details to descendent classes. In your teamwork project, you’ll need to use abstraction, so let’s practice it. 
    In an RPG game there are different types of characters – mages, warriors, priests, etc. They have some common characteristics, so it’s a good idea to have a base class which describes these common characteristics and let the descendants reuse them through inheritance. There are also a set of actions the characters can perform; actions are usually defined in interfaces.*/
